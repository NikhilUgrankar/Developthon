    65.07 % of Indiaâ€™s population lives in its rural area. Indian \
villages are a tight knit community with unique problems and \
issues endemic to the specific region. The youth from the rural \
areas have been migrating to cities in search of work due to \
the absence or rarity of opportunities for employment in rural \
areas. They leave a good quality life in a village for a \
penurious quality of life in cities. \
Smart and Connected Villages will not just impact 65\% of \
Indians but also set a chain reaction catapulting a major \
porting of 'Bharat' towards development and progress. For \
the development to percolate to the grass root level, focus \
must be devoted to the progress of villages. \
